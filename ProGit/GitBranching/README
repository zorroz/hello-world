When commit, Git stores a COMMIT OBJECT that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged. This object also contains the author's name and email, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit(its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.

COMMIT OBJECT: commit, parent, author, committer, tree -> blobs(binary large objects)
SNAPSHOT = tree + blobs

COMMIT1 <- COMMIT2 <- COMMIT3 <-master <-HEAD

A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch in Git is master. When you create a new branch, it will add a new pointer to the same commit you're currently on. 

HEAD: a pointer to the local branch you're currently on.
git checkout <branch> => set HEAD to new branch

1. If you create a new branch before you commit all changes, and you switch to the new branch, all the changes you made after last commit will bring to new branch. You have to commit all changes before you switch back to old branch or changes will be LOST!!!
2. If you made change and switch to another branch(already created), your change will not lost.

git checkout -b <branch> = git branch <branch>; git checkout <branch>

On master, 'git merge testing' merge testing to master, then 'git branch -d testing' to delete testing branch.

conflict resolve: vi conflicted_file, remove all <<<<<HEAD, =====, >>>>>, then run git add conflicted_file to mark it as resolved
